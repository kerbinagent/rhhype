# Active experiment and research loop

## User mandate, 30 September 2026 02:10 UTC

Run the proposed passive RH inventory-exit experiment and continue collecting,
researching and improving until the user stops the work or paper P&L is
convincingly positive. Public data and paper execution only. Maintain the
twenty-minute production reviews while experiments remain separate.

## Current experiment: RH passive exit v1

- Assets: XAG primary; BTC/ETH continuous crypto controls; NVDA a separately
  labeled out-of-regular-session cohort in the current UTC window.
- Sizes: $100/$250/$500/$1,000; primary $1,000. Standard public fees primary,
  Premium as a separately accounted sensitivity. Branches cannot be summed.
- Entry: RH maker buy at a valid best bid, contingent HL short after attributed
  public trade flow. The study assesses possible queue fills, not private fills.
- Four exit comparisons: ten-second taker control, best-ask passive ten-second,
  cost-targeted passive ten-second, cost-targeted passive sixty-second.
- Primary decision: XAG / $1,000 / Standard / targeted passive ten-second.
- Same-entry comparisons require identical admitted entries. A slower branch
  must not be compared with a faster branch using different trading periods
  without also reporting candidate coverage and portfolio differences.
- Fixed passive exit price in v1; no hindsight repricing. Full lifecycle includes
  delayed activation/cancel, partials, contingent HL buybacks, emergency exits,
  late prints and unresolved obligations. No reset that erases exposure.
- Calibrate the adverse HL buyback move from prior public buy-aggressor flow;
  freeze it for the holdout. Fees, capital and the 5 bp stress are separate.
- Freeze method, all implementation dependencies and fresh metadata before
  capture. Thirty minutes of calibration followed by twenty minutes holdout;
  final 80 seconds admit no new entries to permit bounded liquidation.

Engine, coordinator, metadata and independent accounting/performance reviews
are being implemented in parallel. No v1 capture has started yet. Original
frozen replay files and the production strategy remain separate.

## Operational success threshold

This is a research stopping threshold, not proof of executable profitability.
Require the predeclared primary policy to achieve all of:

1. At least 100 fully closed cycles over at least two fresh twenty-minute
   holdouts, with positive total stressed net in each holdout.
2. At least $10 combined net after all modeled fill fees, the declared 5 bp
   stress and capital; profit factor at least 1.5.
3. The net and profit factor include **all admitted known outcomes**, including
   failed hedges, partial/rescue losses and zero-flow attempts. They are not
   conditional on successful cycle completion alone.
4. No unresolved economic obligations, missing required funding or execution
   uncertainty in the scored portfolio. Unknowns do not count as zero profit.
5. Results and adverse tails remain visible by size, tier and asset. USDG/USDC
   parity and public queue assumptions remain explicit limitations.

Repeated research and stopping when results look favorable introduce selection
risk. A later promising policy needs its own frozen confirmation windows; a
positive branch discovered among many alternatives is exploratory evidence.

## Loop

Implement → audit → freeze → collect bounded fresh data → replay → examine
all outcomes and coverage → write notebook and commit → choose one justified
next change or replication. During collection, review production on its
twenty-minute schedule and research the next concrete hypothesis. Never alter
an in-flight experiment's frozen source or train on its holdout outcomes.

Each capture and derived output has an explicit cap. Before any repeat, check
the cumulative research footprint and retain a bounded number of raw studies;
do not create an unbounded automatic capture loop. The user may stop the active
work at any time; stop study collection gracefully and preserve terminal
inventory and manifests rather than fabricate a close.
